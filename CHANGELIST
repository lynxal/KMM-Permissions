0.0.4
Fixed an issue with opening system settings on iOS. Previously, users reported a terminal warning:
“BUG IN CLIENT OF UIKIT: The caller of UIApplication.openURL(:) needs to migrate to the non-deprecated UIApplication.open(:options:completionHandler:). Force returning false (NO).”
This version updates the implementation to use the modern API and resolves the warning.
